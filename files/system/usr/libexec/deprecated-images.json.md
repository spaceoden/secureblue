# Deprecated Images

The following image types have been deprecated:

## bluefin/aurora

Rationale: See https://github.com/secureblue/secureblue/releases/tag/v3.2.2

Rebase to: The equivalent image replacing `bluefin` with `silverblue` or `aurora` with `kinoite`. For example, for `aurora-nvidia-hardened`, rebase to `kinoite-nvidia-hardened`.

## server

Rationale: Upstream decisions have required us to [fork](https://github.com/secureblue/coreos/). This brings with it the following critical migration steps *before* rebasing:

- Password-based auth is no longer supported, ensure you are able to log-in using pubkey or another supported method. If you do not do this, you risk being locked out of your host.
- Tailscale and cockpit are no longer included by default (but the tailscale repo is). If you need either, ensure you have layered them before rebooting into your new deployment.

Rebase to: The equivalent image replacing `server` with `securecore`. For example, for `server-nvidia-hardened`, rebase to `securecore-nvidia-hardened`.

## framework

Rationale: [Deprecated upstream](https://github.com/ublue-os/framework#this-image-is-deprecated)

Rebase to: The equivalent image replacing `-framework` with `-main`. For example, for `kinoite-framework-hardened`, rebase to `kinoite-main-hardened`.

## main-laptop

Rationale: Upstream recommendations have changed and improvements are being made to PPD. 

Rebase to: The equivalent image without `-laptop`. For example, for `kinoite-main-laptop-hardened`, rebase to `kinoite-main-hardened`.

## nvidia-laptop

Rationale: Upstream recommendations have changed and improvements are being made to PPD. Additionally, nvidia optimus configuration has moved to upstream `just` commands.

Rebase to: The equivalent image without `-laptop`. For example, for `kinoite-nvidia-laptop-hardened`, rebase to `kinoite-nvidia-hardened` and reboot.
