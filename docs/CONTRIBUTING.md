### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report should describe the issue in detail. Generally speaking:

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Remember that these are unofficial builds, it's usually prudent to investigate an issue before reporting it here or in Fedora!
- Collect information about the bug:
  - `rpm-ostree status -v` usually helps
- Image and Version
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

### Pull Requests

#### Before Submitting a Pull Request

A good pull request should be ready for review before it is even created. For all pull requests, ensure:

- You have no unnecessary changes, including whitespace changes
- You have tested your changes
- For substantive changes, you include evidence of proper functionality in the pull request in addition to the build results.
- Your commits are [verified](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification)

### How to test incoming changes

One of the nice things about the image model is that we can generate an entire OS image for every change we want to commit, so this makes testing way easier than in the past. You can rebase to it, see if it works, and then move back. This also means we can increase the amount of testers!

We strive towards a model where proposed changes are more thoroughly reviewed and tested by the community. So here's how to do it. If you see a pull request that is opened up on an image you're following you can leave a review on how it's working for you.

## Building Locally

The minimum tools required are git and a working machine with podman enabled and configured.
Building locally is much faster than building in GitHub and is a good way to move fast before pushing to a remote.

### Clone the repo

    git clone https://github.com/secureblue/secureblue.git

### Build the image

First make sure you can build an existing image:

    podman build . -t something

Then confirm your image built:

    podman image ls

TODO: Set up and push to your own local registry

### Make your changes

This usually involved editing the `Containerfile`. Most techniques for building containers apply here, if you're new to containers using the term "Dockerfile" in your searches usually shows more results when you're searching for information.

## Styleguides
### Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and enforce them with a bot to keep the changelogs tidy:

```
chore: add Oyster build script
docs: explain hat wobble
feat: add beta sequence
fix: remove broken confirmation message
refactor: share logic between 4d3d3d3 and flarhgunnstow
style: convert tabs to spaces
test: ensure Tayne retains clothing
```
