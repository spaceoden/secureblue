This repo uses [BlueBuild](https://blue-build.org/) to generate hardened operating system images, using [Fedora Atomic Desktop](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/)'s [base images](https://pagure.io/workstation-ostree-config) as a starting point.

# Scope

secureblue applies hardening with the following goals in mind:

- Increase defenses against the exploitation of both known and unknown vulnerabilities.
- Avoid sacrificing usability for most use cases where possible.

The following are not in scope:
- Anything that sacrifices security for "privacy". Fedora is already sufficiently private and "privacy" often serves as a euphemism for security theater. This is especially true when at odds with improving security.
- Anything related to "degoogling" chromium. For example, we will not be replacing [hardened-chromium](https://github.com/secureblue/hardened-chromium) with Brave or ungoogled-chromium. Both of them make changes that sacrifice security for "privacy", such as enabling MV2. <sup>[why?](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/improve-security)</sup>

# Hardening

- Installing and enabling [hardened_malloc](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc) globally, including for flatpaks. <sup>[Thanks to rusty-snake's spec](https://github.com/rusty-snake/fedora-extras)</sup>
- Installing [hardened-chromium](https://github.com/secureblue/hardened-chromium), which is inspired by [Vanadium](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium). <sup>[Why chromium?](https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing)</sup> <sup>[Why not flatpak chromium?](https://forum.vivaldi.net/post/669805)</sup>
- Setting numerous hardened sysctl values <sup>[details](https://github.com/secureblue/secureblue/blob/live/files/system/etc/sysctl.d/hardening.conf)</sup>
- Remove SUID-root from [numerous binaries](https://github.com/secureblue/secureblue/blob/live/files/scripts/removesuid.sh) and replace functionality [using capabilities](https://github.com/secureblue/secureblue/blob/live/files/system/usr/bin/setcapsforunsuidbinaries)
- Disable Xwayland by default (for GNOME, Plasma, and Sway images)
- Mitigation of [LD_PRELOAD attacks](https://github.com/Aishou/wayland-keylogger) via `ujust toggle-bash-environment-lockdown`
- Disabling coredumps
- Disabling all ports and services for firewalld
- Adds per-network MAC randomization
- Blacklisting numerous unused kernel modules to reduce attack surface <sup>[details](https://github.com/secureblue/secureblue/blob/live/files/system/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf)</sup>
- Enabling only the [flathub-verified](https://flathub.org/apps/collection/verified/1) remote by default
- Sets numerous hardening kernel arguments (Inspired by [Madaidan's Hardening Guide](https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/guides/linux-hardening.html)) <sup>[details](KARGS.md)</sup>
- Require wheel user authentication via polkit for `rpm-ostree install` <sup>[why?](https://github.com/rohanssrao/silverblue-privesc)
- Brute force protection by locking user accounts for 24 hours after 50 failed login attempts, hardened password encryption and password quality suggestions
- Installing usbguard and providing `ujust` commands to automatically configure it
- Installing bubblejail for additional sandboxing tooling
- Set opportunistic DNSSEC and DNSOverTLS for systemd-resolved
- Configure chronyd to use Network Time Security (NTS) <sup>[using chrony config from GrapheneOS](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/infrastructure/blob/main/chrony.conf)</sup>
- Disable KDE GHNS by default <sup>[why?](https://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/blog/kde-store-content/)</sup>
- Disable install & usage of GNOME user extensions by default
- Use HTTPS for all rpm mirrors
- Set all default container policies to `reject`, `signedBy`, or `sigstoreSigned`
- Disable a variety of services by default (including cups, geoclue, passim, and others)
- Removal of the unmaintained and suid-root fuse2 by default
- Disabling unprivileged user namespaces by default for the unconfined domain and the container domain

# Rationale

Fedora is one of the few distributions that ships with selinux and associated tooling built-in and enabled by default. This makes it advantageous as a starting point for building a hardened system. However, out of the box it's lacking hardening in numerous other areas. This project's goal is to improve on that significantly.

# Customization

If you want to add your own customizations on top of secureblue, you are advised strongly against forking. Instead, create a repo for your own image by using the [BlueBuild template](https://github.com/blue-build/template), then change your `base-image` to a secureblue image. This will allow you to apply your customizations to secureblue in a concise and maintainable way, without the need to constantly sync with upstream.

# FAQ

If you're encountering a problem or have a question, please consult the [FAQ](FAQ.md). If you can't find your answer there, please ask in the support channel on Discord.

# Sponsor

Sponsorship options are on the [Donate](DONATE.md) page. All donations are appreciated. Sponsors get a role on the Discord if desired. If you've donated but haven't yet been tagged with the role, please reach out to me.

# Installation

Have a look at [PREINSTALL-README](PREINSTALL-README.md) before proceeding.

## Rebasing
> [!NOTE]
> If you don't already have a Fedora Atomic installation, use a Fedora Atomic ISO that matches your secureblue target image to install one. If you want to use a secureblue Silverblue image, start with the Fedora Silverblue ISO, Kinoite for Kinoite, Sericea (Sway Atomic) for Sericea and all the Wayblue images, and CoreOS for all the securecore images.
> 
> For more details on the available images, have a look at [IMAGES](IMAGES.md) before proceeding.

To rebase a [Fedora Atomic](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/) or [Fedora CoreOS](https://fedoraproject.org/coreos/) installation, download the script below:

[![Download](https://shields.io/badge/-Download-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=download&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/secureblue/secureblue/releases/latest/download/install_secureblue.sh)

Then, run it from the directory you downloaded it to:

```
bash install_secureblue.sh
```


# Post-install

After installation, [yafti](https://github.com/ublue-os/yafti) will open. Make sure to follow the steps listed carefully and read the directions closely.

Then follow the [POSTINSTALL-README](POSTINSTALL-README.md).

# Contributing

Follow the [contributing documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing), and make sure to respect the [CoC](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Development

For local Development [building locally](CONTRIBUTING.md#building-locally) is the recommended approach.

## Community
Opening issues is preferred, but [Discord](https://discord.gg/qMTv5cKfbF) is available as well.
